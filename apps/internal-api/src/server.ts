 * The production entry point.

 * `dev-server.ts` carried a comment saying "production runs this app as a container on EKS with its
 * own entrypoint" — and that entrypoint did not exist. `src/index.ts` exports the Hono app and does
 * not listen, so the container built from it started, did nothing, and exited 0. A healthy-looking
 * exit code, no logs, and no server: the failure mode a readiness probe would eventually catch and
 * nothing else would explain.
 *
 * Separate from `dev-server.ts` rather than shared, because the two differ in the part that matters:
 * a dev server should die fast when `turbo` tears it down, and this one must not.

  `PORT` first, then this app's own `API_PORT`.

  Every platform that runs a web process tells it where to listen through `PORT`, and SproutOS is
  no exception — the Lambda Web Adapter forwards each invocation to that port and gives up if
  nothing answers. Reading only `API_PORT` meant the server started, listened on 3001, and the
  adapter waited on 8080 until the invocation timed out: no error, no crash, just
  `app is not ready after 28000ms` and a request that never returns.

  `API_PORT` is kept because local development sets it, and a convention this app already has is
  not worth breaking to adopt another.

 * client seeing that failure is a customer, not a health check.
 *
 * The 25-second cap sits under the pod's 30-second default grace period, so the process chooses its
